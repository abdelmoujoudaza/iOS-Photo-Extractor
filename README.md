# iOS-Photo-Extractor
Extracts photos from every Jailbroken iOS device that is on the same network.

I wrote this script to draw attention to the importance for jailbreakers to change their default password given by Apple.

This script exploits the fact that many people jailbreak their phones and never change their root password. When an iPhone is jailbroken, it can be connected to via SSH with it's user and password.
